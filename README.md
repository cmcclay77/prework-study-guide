# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

My motivation for completing the Prework was to learn a very basic understanding of what a begginer will encounter learning to code.  It also helped to build self confidence early in the curriculum.  

This project was built to act as an evolving study guide for future material that I will learn as the course progresses.  

The problem that this Prework project solved for me, was my complete lack of understanding of what the world of coding is all about.  It also helped me to gain a small glimpse of what I will eventually learn.  

I learned about using Git and GitHub and some basics about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  There were a lot of commands that we used and through repetition I hope to learn them all moving forward.
